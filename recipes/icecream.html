                <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A recipe for an ice cream combo. Of course I would not go through the hassle of making industrial ice cream, it is the combo that counts.</p>
        <p>Combos are a great way to pack your ice cream with a punch of flavors, especially when you mind your diet and want to sate the craving with less ice cream.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Utensils: ice cream scoop, bowl(s)</li>
            <li>Your favorite ice cream flavor, get a gallon for bulk buy value every time you raid your local grocery store.</li>
            <li>Toppings: fruit slices, chocolate fudge, rainbow sprinkles, et cetera.</li>
            <li>Waffles or waffle cones for the crunchiness</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide how many scoops of ice cream to consume. Constrained by your diet.</li>
            <li>Scoop the icecream into the bowl</li>
            <li>Throw on the toppings and waffles in a very specific order. Trust me, it matters a whole lot (yes it does)</li>
            <li>Enjoy slowly, do <em>not</em> put an entire scoop into your mouth at once.</li>
        </ol>
