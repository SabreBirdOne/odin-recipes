        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A recipe for homemade tacos. Tacos are highly customizable so feel free to experiment.</p>

        <p>Tacos are also portable, so you can build websites like these with the other hand. But for the protein (and web development) I'm going for, I'm going to need bigger hands.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Tortilla flat bread, wheat or corn varieties</li>
            <li>Ground beef, or chicken tenders/slices</li>
            <li>Salad, spinach or kale</li>
            <li>Tomatoes, corn, et cetera</li>
            <li>Queso cheese. These are lighter on fat and tastes subtle, they're great.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay the flatbread directly on (some plate on) the table</li>
            <li>Place the salad in first, It's a layer around the filling to keep things inside moist</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef or meat filling along with other vegetables on top of the salad.</li>
            <li>Fold up the flat bread into tacos</li>
            <li>Optionally, air fry the tacos a bit more (400<sup>o</sup>F at around 4-5 minutes) for the bread to go crispy.</li>
            <li>Pour enough cheese on the tacos <strong><sub>to strike fear in the people around you.</sub></strong> </li>
        </ol>
