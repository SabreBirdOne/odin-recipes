        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A recipe for homemade sushi. This can be customized with any filling you like, not just traditional (Japanese) ones. There are 2 types: uramaki (rice on the outside) and norimaki (seaweed on the outside)</p>

        <p>Sushi is great when made in bulk, because you and your company will definitely ask for more. At least I would if you tempted me with a plate of it.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>A sushi rolling mat for easy rolling over of the Ingredients</li>
            <li>Jasmine rice: white and sticky</li>
            <li>Sushi nori: seaweed</li>
            <li>Filling: avocado slices, raw or cooked tuna or salmon, cucumber, anything.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>We make sushi by spreading the ingredients onto this mat in a rectangular "cake" to be rolled into sushi.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay the rolling mat flat on a clean table.</li>
            
            <li>Do some math to determine the sushi size. Circle perimeter (the length of your roll) = diameter (the height of the roll in the resulting sushi) times 3.14. Meanwhile, the width of your roll determines how much sushi to make. The amount of rice and later filling is constrained by your sushi's radius</li>
            <li>Place rice and seaweed in layers, in any order you like.  </li>
            <li>Place the filling onto the "cake" - there should not be much.</li>
            <li>With the edge of the rolling mat, roll over the cake to form a sushi "pipe"</li>
            <li>Slice this "pipe" in bite sized pieces to get sushi rolls</li>
        </ol>
